# Integration testing

- **Component Interaction**: Integration testing focuses on verifying the interaction and collaboration between different software components or modules. It ensures that these components work cohesively when combined.
- **Data Flow Validation**: Integration tests examine the flow of data between various parts of the system. They validate that data is transferred correctly and processed accurately as it moves between different components.
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Integration testing involves verifying the interactions between various API endpoints. Ensure that endpoints are properly connected and function as expected, covering typical use cases, error handling, and edge cases.

## Checklist
1. **Use Random Data**: Utilize random data, such as usernames and emails, to prevent clashes with existing data in the database. This ensures test isolation.

2. **Clean-Up After Tests**: Always remember to delete or clean up any data that the tests have added. Utilize "beforeEach" or "afterEach" hooks for a clean slate for each test case.

3. **Separate Tests by Concerns**: Group tests by concerns or features. Organize tests into sections like "test create user," "test login," "test image upload," for clarity.

4. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Ensure test case names are descriptive and indicative of what is being tested for easy comprehension.

5. **Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA)**: Follow the AAA pattern for test cases - Arrange, Act, and Assert. Set up data, perform actions, and verify outcomes.

6. **Comments and Documentation**: Add comments or documentation within test code to explain the test's purpose and specific conditions.

7. **Separate Unit and Integration Tests**: Separate unit tests (testing individual functions or components) from integration tests (testing interactions between components).

8. **Test Coverage**: Aim for good test coverage, including normal and edge cases to catch potential issues.

9. **Test for Error Cases**: Test error cases to ensure graceful handling of invalid input or error conditions.

10. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks or stubs for external dependencies (databases, APIs) to isolate tests from actual external behavior.

11. **Parameterized Tests**: Consider parameterized tests to run the same test with different input data for robustness.

12. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate tests into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automatic testing on code changes.

13. **Test Security**: If dealing with sensitive data or authentication, include security tests to verify security measures.

14. **Performance Testing**: Add performance tests to evaluate API performance under various loads.

15. **Regression Testing**: Regularly run tests to detect regressions when new features or changes are introduced to the codebase.
