## Assignments

### Enhancing the Restaurant App with Filter and Display Feature

In this assignment, you will enhance your restaurant app by implementing a feature that allows users to filter and
display only Sodexho or Compass restaurants. This assignment will emphasize the use of `map` and `filter` methods
with arrays, promoting a modern and functional approach to solving the problem.

**Requirements:**

1. Refactor your previous restaurant assignment code to make effective use of array methods like `forEach`, `map`
   and `filter`.

2. Implement the feature to filter and display only Sodexho or Compass restaurants using the `filter` method. Use arrow
   functions to streamline the filtering process.

3. Implement robust error handling for user interactions, such as displaying informative messages in case of failures.
