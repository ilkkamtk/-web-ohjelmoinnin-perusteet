Many concepts related to asynchronous programming and Promises are similar between JavaScript and TypeScript since
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. However, TypeScript introduces some additional features and benefits that can
enhance the development experience and help catch errors early. Here's how asynchronous programming in TypeScript
compares to JavaScript:

1. **Type Annotations and Safety:** TypeScript's static typing allows you to specify types for variables, function
   parameters, and return values. This can help catch type-related errors in your asynchronous code before runtime,
   ensuring that you're using the correct data types throughout your async operations.

2. **Promises with Type Annotations:** In TypeScript, you can use type annotations to specify the type of data that a
   Promise will resolve to or reject with. This can provide better code documentation and prevent potential type
   mismatches when handling Promise results.

3. **Async/Await with Type Safety:** TypeScript's async/await syntax allows you to write asynchronous code that looks
   more like synchronous code. The added benefit is that you can specify the expected return type of an async function
   using type annotations, improving readability and safety.

4. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Support:** TypeScript's type system provides better tooling and code
   suggestions in modern IDEs. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with asynchronous operations, as the IDE
   can provide information about expected types and available methods, reducing the likelihood of mistakes.

5. **TypeScript-specific Libraries and Patterns:** TypeScript has its own set of libraries and patterns that work well
   with asynchronous programming. For example, the `ts-utils` library provides utility functions for working with
   Promises in a type-safe manner.

6. **Better Error Handling:** TypeScript's type system can help catch potential errors related to Promise chaining, null
   and undefined values, and incorrect usage of async/await.

While the core concepts of asynchronous programming and Promises remain consistent between JavaScript and TypeScript,
TypeScript's type system and language features can provide additional benefits that contribute to more reliable,
maintainable, and type-safe asynchronous code.
