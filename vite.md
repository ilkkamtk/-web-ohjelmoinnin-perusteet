## Vite

Vite is a build tool and development server that caters to the demands of modern web development. Unlike traditional
bundlers, which package the entire application into larger bundles, Vite takes a different approach. It focuses on
delivering a faster and more efficient development experience by leveraging the capabilities of ES modules.

### Advantages

- Faster development iterations due to rapid startup and on-demand compilation.
- Enhanced developer experience with instantaneous HMR for immediate feedback.
- Better performance for both development and production builds.
- Compatibility with various frameworks and libraries, including TypeScript.
- Built-in support for TypeScript, making it easy to adopt in projects.

### Disadvantages

- Limited Browser Compatibility: Vite's use of ES modules might not be fully compatible with older browsers. This could
  pose challenges if your target audience includes users on outdated browsers.
- Plugin Ecosystem: While Vite has been gaining traction, its plugin ecosystem might not be as extensive as that of more
  established tools like webpack. This could lead to a lack of certain features or integrations.

## Setting Up a Vite Project with TypeScript

1. **Installation**
   To get started with a Vite project using TypeScript, follow these steps:

    - **With prompts:**
      ```bash
      npm create vite@latest
      ```

    - **...or specify options:**
      ```bash
      npm create-vite@latest your-project-name -- --template vanilla-ts
      ```

2. **Project Initialization**
    - After installation, navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-name
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Building**
    - To build your Vite project for production, use the following command:
   ```bash
    npm run build
   ```
    - This command compiles and bundles your application, optimizing it for production. The resulting files are located
      in the dist directory by default.

4. **Deployment**:
    - Deploying a Vite project is similar to deploying any other web application. You can use various hosting
      services or deploy it to your server. Remember to serve the files from the `dist` directory.
