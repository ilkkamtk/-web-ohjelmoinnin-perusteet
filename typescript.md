# TypeScript
* is a syntactic superset of JavaScript, an open source project maintained by Microsoft to add types to JavaScript. 
* comes in three parts: programming language, language server, and compiler. 
* is increasingly becoming popular and ubiquitous in front-end development. 
* allows code authors to leave more of their intent on the page, making it clearer and reducing the risk of multiple interpretations. 
* has the potential to move some types of errors from runtime to compile time. 
* can catch errors such as incomplete refactoring, missing values, and internal contracts within the code base. 
* The use of TypeScript can increase productivity and help developers catch errors early on. 
* is compatible with React and other popular front-end frameworks. 
* is easy to set up and use in many front-end projects. 
* Learning TypeScript is an important skill for front-end developers.
